    "# GraphRAG Implementation with LlamaIndex\n",
    "\n",
    "[GraphRAG (Graphs + Retrieval Augmented Generation)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/graphrag/) combines the strengths of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and Query-Focused Summarization (QFS) to effectively handle complex queries over large text datasets. While RAG excels in fetching precise information, it struggles with broader queries that require thematic understanding, a challenge that QFS addresses but cannot scale well. GraphRAG integrates these approaches to offer responsive and thorough querying capabilities across extensive, diverse text corpora.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides guidance on constructing the GraphRAG pipeline using the LlamaIndex PropertyGraph abstractions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** This is an approximate implementation of GraphRAG. We are currently developing a series of cookbooks that will detail the exact implementation of GraphRAG."

    "## GraphRAG Aproach\n",
    "\n",
    "The GraphRAG involves two steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Graph Generation - Creates Graph, builds communities and its summaries over the given document.\n",
    "2. Answer to the Query - Use summaries of the communities created from step-1 to answer the query.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Graph Generation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Source Documents to Text Chunks:** Source documents are divided into smaller text chunks for easier processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Text Chunks to Element Instances:** Each text chunk is analyzed to identify and extract entities and relationships, resulting in a list of tuples that represent these elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Element Instances to Element Summaries:** The extracted entities and relationships are summarized into descriptive text blocks for each element using the LLM.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Element Summaries to Graph Communities:** These entities, relationships and summaries form a graph, which is subsequently partitioned into communities using algorithms using Heirarchical Leiden to establish a hierarchical structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Graph Communities to Community Summaries:** The LLM generates summaries for each community, providing insights into the dataset’s overall topical structure and semantics.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answering the Query:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Community Summaries to Global Answers:** The summaries of the communities are utilized to respond to user queries. This involves generating intermediate answers, which are then consolidated into a comprehensive global answer.\n"

    "1. `llm:` The language model used for extraction.\n",
    "2. `extract_prompt:` A prompt template used to guide the LLM in extracting information.\n",
    "3. `parse_fn:` A function to parse the LLM's output into structured data.\n",
    "4. `max_paths_per_chunk:` Limits the number of triples extracted per text chunk.\n",
    "5. `num_workers:` For parallel processing of multiple text nodes.\n",

    "**Extraction Process:**\n",
    "\n",
    "For each input node (chunk of text):\n",
    "1. It sends the text to the LLM along with the extraction prompt.\n",
    "2. The LLM's response is parsed to extract entities, relationships, descriptions for entities and relations.\n",
    "3. Entities are converted into EntityNode objects. Entity description is stored in metadata\n",
    "4. Relationships are converted into Relation objects. Relationship description is stored in metadata.\n",
    "5. These are added to the node's metadata under KG_NODES_KEY and KG_RELATIONS_KEY.\n",

    "Given a text document, identify all entities and their entity types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.\n",
    "Given the text, extract up to {max_knowledge_triplets} entity-relation triplets.\n",
    "\n",
    "-Steps-\n",
    "1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n",
    "- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n",
    "- entity_type: Type of the entity\n",
    "- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\n",
    "\n",
    "2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\n",
    "For each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n",
    "- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n",
    "- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n",
    "- relation: relationship between source_entity and target_entity\n",
    "- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Output Formatting:\n",
    "- Return the result in valid JSON format with two keys: 'entities' (list of entity objects) and 'relationships' (list of relationship objects).\n",
    "- Exclude any text outside the JSON structure (e.g., no explanations or comments).\n",
