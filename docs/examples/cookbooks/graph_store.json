The new smartphone has a design similar to its Vivo X90 series siblings — Vivo X90 and Vivo X90 Pro. The Vivo X90s is shown to have a Zeiss-tuned triple rear camera unit. The upcoming model is expected to retain the key specification of the Vivo X90. Meanwhile, Chinese tipsters have leaked the specifications of the upcoming handset. The Vivo X90s is said to run on MediaTek Dimensity 9200+ SoC and could be offered in four different colour options.\nJia Jingdong posted an image of the Vivo X90s on the Chinese microblogging platform providing us a glimpse of the design from the rear. The render shows the handset in a white finish with rounded corners. The image suggests Zeiss branded triple rear cameras on the rear panel along with an LED flash. It seems to have a glass back with the Vivo branding at the bottom.\nVivo, however, didn't confirm the exact launch date or key specifications of the Vivo X90s.\nSeparately, several Chinese tipsters posted specifications of the upcoming Vivo X90s on Weibo. According to the tipsters, the handset will be powered by the latest MediaTek Dimensity 9200+ SoC. This would be an upgrade over the MediaTek Dimensity 9200 SoC found on the vanilla Vivo X90. The new model is said to offer Wi-Fi 7 connectivity and could be offered in black, blue, green, red, and white colour options. The Vivo X90, in contrast, has Wi-Fi 6 and is available in China Red, Ice Blue, and Original Black (translated from Chinese) in China.\nA TENAA listing from May revealed the specifications of the Vivo X90s. As per the listing, it will have a 6.78-inch 1.5K (1,280 x 2,800 pixels) curved AMOLED display. The screen has a centre-aligned hole-punch cutout at the top. It is listed to carry up to 16GB of RAM along with up to 1TB of inbuilt storage.\nOppo, OnePlus, Realme to Operate as Separate Entities in India: Report\nThe triple rear camera setup of the handset could include a 50-megapixel main camera sensor, accompanied by a 12-megapixel ultra-wide lens, and a 12-megapixel portrait sensor. It is said to pack a 32-megapixel selfie camera as well. Vivo is expected to provide a 4,690mAh battery on the Vivo X90s.\nThe Vivo X90 Pro has finally made its debut in India, but is the company's flagship smartphone for 2023 equipped with enough upgrades over its predecessor?

Watt has yet to properly file his retirement with the NFL\nThe Houston Texans have ramped up their defensive needs with the reported signing of Maliek Collins on Wednesday, June 14.\nAccording to Adam Schefter of ESPN, both sides sealed the deal on a contract extension with Collins accepting a $23 million contract extension.\n\"The deal was negotiated by Texans' GM Nick Caserio and director of football administration Andrew Brown with Collins' agents Drew Rosenhaus and Ryan Matha,\" the scribe wrote on his Twitter post\nThe new deal gives Collins a bit of a raise and reportedly includes a $20 million guarantee.\nIn his previous contract, the 28-year-old was earning $17 million with $8.5 million of that guaranteed.\nThis will be his third year in the NFL, having had previous stops with the Dallas Cowboys (2016-2019) and the Las Vegas Raiders (2020).\nThe Kansas native had a career-high 37 tackles to go with 3.5 sacks over 15 games last NFL season.\nHe is projected to be a key piece in the defensive line of the Texans for the next couple of years.\nLooking ahead, Collins is expected to fit in nicely with the 4-3 alignment that DeMeco Ryans is expected to implement.\nHe is likely to become a full-time defensive tackle according to Sam Robison of Pro Football Talk.\nWith the Texans in rebuilding mode, Collins was seen as one of the bright spots for the team. He started 15 games between 2021 and 2022, combining for six sacks and 18 tackles for a loss.\nNow, he will be paid better, which means he will have added responsibility–particularly on the defensive side of the Texans' fence.\nThe Collins deal also comes not long after other defensive tackles landed new deals with their respective teams. That list includes Dexter Lawrence, Daron Payne, Jeffery Simmons and Ed Oliver.\nThere are still other names expected to land new contracts this NFL offseason. Yet to come to terms with their teams include Chris Jones of the Kansas City Chiefs and Quinnen Williams of the New York Jets.\nIn related news, there remain questions in the air on whether J.J. Watt is officially retired.\nAccording to a report by CBS Sports, Watt has yet to fill out his retirement papers with the NFL.\nThis was despite his retiring last NFL season in an emotional game that saw him record two sacks in his allegedly final NFL game.\nMoreover, the five-time first-team All-Pro does not intend to sign a one-day deal with the Texans although this is tied to him being inducted into the club's Ring of Honor.\n\"I personally just don't really understand or see the reason for it,\" Watt stated. \"It's more just a ceremonial piece of paper. I think that the Ring of Honor and all that comes with it is more than enough.\"","id_":"98c0ca61-4757-4ae6-94a1-b721ac12fba9"},"163655dd-a432-4f51-8fcf-b22220351989":{"label":"text_chunk","embedding":null,"properties":{"_node_content":"{\"id_\": \"163655dd-a432-4f51-8fcf-b22220351989\", \"embedding\": null, \"metadata\": {}, \"excluded_embed_metadata_keys\": [], \"excluded_llm_metadata_keys\": [], \"relationships\": {\"1\": {\"node_id\": \"b05bd75c-869d-4dc6-8240-9b8b28b601c5\", \"node_type\": \"4\", \"metadata\": {}, \"hash\": \"70496fcae8b6def9a6c155aadde8a8e5bb8386bfb7fdac65a337500ddacdd162\", \"class_name\": \"RelatedNodeInfo\"}}, \"metadata_template\": \"{key}: {value}\", \"metadata_separator\": \"\\n\", \"text\": \"\", \"mimetype\": \"text/plain\", \"start_char_idx\": 0, \"end_char_idx\": 2045, \"text_template\": \"{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}\", \"class_name\": \"TextNode\"}","_node_type":"TextNode","document_id":"b05bd75c-869d-4dc6-8240-9b8b28b601c5","doc_id":"b05bd75c-869d-4dc6-8240-9b8b28b601c5","ref_doc_id":"b05bd75c-869d-4dc6-8240-9b8b28b601c5"},"text":"Gordon McQueen, former Manchester United and Leeds player, dies at 70: MANCHESTER, England — Gordon McQueen, a defender who played for Manchester United, Leeds and Scotland’s national team, has died.

Signing a top striker is a priority for Ten Hag but Spurs do not want to sell Kane and Napoli’s asking price for Victor Osimhen is prohibitive. Atalanta’s Rasmus Højlund is a target, but the Dane is one for the future.\nUnited must also decide whether to improve their offer for the Chelsea midfielder Mason Mount, after having an opening bid of £40m turned down. They could decide to spend heavily on a goalkeeper if they cannot sign a world-class No 9.\nDe Gea was at fault for Manchester City’s winner in the FA Cup final and his unconvincing distribution has raised doubts over whether the 32-year-old is suited to Ten Hag’s football. Chelsea and United have registered an interest in Onana with Inter, whose financial problems could force them to sell. It is believed the Cameroon international would favour a move to United. Costa is an alternative target for Ten Hag. The 23-year-old is highly rated and a Portugal international.\nOnana is excellent with the ball at his feet and impressed during Inter’s run to the Champions League final, where they were beaten 1-0 by Manchester City. Inter fear they will lose Onana and have inquired about Brentford’s David Raya, who is wanted by Tottenham.\nSigning Onana would fix a problem area for Chelsea, who will listen to offers for Kepa Arrizabalaga and Édouard Mendy. Arrizabalaga’s high wages could make him harder to sell than Mendy, who lost his place to the Spaniard last season. Chelsea have also targeted Milan’s Mike Maignan and Valencia’s Giorgi Mamardashvili.\nChelsea have held talks with Inter over a number of issues this week. Along with discussing Onana, Inter have explored signing Kalidou Koulibaly and Romelu Lukaku on loan. Chelsea need to raise funds and would prefer to sell Koulibaly and Lukaku.\nChelsea want £70m plus add-ons for Mount. They are expected to sell Mateo Kovacic to Manchester City and want £70m for Kai Havertz, who is a target for Arsenal.","id_":"31227f1f-a80c-4dc6-8e49-9a93bd14f722"},"4ec46fd4-1963-40c8-92a3-659e735a05d0":{"label":"text_chunk","embedding":null,"properties":{"_node_content":"{\"id_\": \"4ec46fd4-1963-40c8-92a3-659e735a05d0\", \"embedding\": null, \"metadata\": {}, \"excluded_embed_metadata_keys\": [], \"excluded_llm_metadata_keys\": [], \"relationships\": {\"1\": {\"node_id\": \"9744337f-1f55-4a0a-859d-e20b4ebdf310\", \"node_type\": \"4\", \"metadata\": {}, \"hash\": \"171242445b54c3240dc7223514019c85565d9bad3fbe65a6d7e2c0379b6efb90\", \"class_name\": \"RelatedNodeInfo\"}}, \"metadata_template\": \"{key}: {value}\", \"metadata_separator\": \"\\n\", \"text\": \"\", \"mimetype\": \"text/plain\", \"start_char_idx\": 0, \"end_char_idx\": 3646, \"text_template\": \"{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}\", \"class_name\": \"TextNode\"}","_node_type":"TextNode","document_id":"9744337f-1f55-4a0a-859d-e20b4ebdf310","doc_id":"9744337f-1f55-4a0a-859d-e20b4ebdf310","ref_doc_id":"9744337f-1f55-4a0a-859d-e20b4ebdf310"},"text":"Coinbase Announces Repurchase of 0.50% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2026: Coinbase Announces Repurchase of 0.50% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2026\nRepurchasing $64.5 million of convertible senior notes at approximately 29% discount to par value\nOn June 14, 2023, Coinbase Global, Inc. (the “Company” or “Coinbase”) entered into separate, privately negotiated purchase agreements with a limited number of holders of its 0.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 (the “Notes”) to repurchase (the “Repurchases”) $64.5 million aggregate principal amount of the Notes. The Company estimates that it will expend approximately $45.5 million in cash to consummate the Repurchases. The transaction represents an approximately 29% discount to par value.\nThe Company previously entered into capped call transactions with certain financial institutions in connection with the initial issuance of the Notes. All of these transactions are expected to remain in effect notwithstanding the Repurchases.\nThe Repurchases are expected to close on or about June 20, 2023, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions. Following such closings, approximately $1.373 billion principal amount of the Notes will remain outstanding.\n“We are always looking for the best opportunities to deploy capital to create shareholder value,” said Alesia Haas, Chief Financial Officer of Coinbase. “As we stated in our most recent shareholder letter, the first quarter of 2023 was a turning point in building a company that is more efficient and financially disciplined. This opportunistic repurchase is a continuation of those efforts and reflects our confidence in our business, strong first quarter financial performance, and improved competitive positioning. We have reduced our 2026 convertible senior notes outstanding and we will look for additional such opportunities in the future.”\nCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains “forward-looking statements” including, among other things, statements relating to the anticipated cash expenditure to consummate the Repurchases and associated discount to par value, as well as the completion, timing and size of the Repurchases.

Selected other teams across Pots Three and Four include AC Milan, Real Sociedad and Celtic.\nThat means City could face a run of fixtures like Liverpool at home, Real Madrid away, and Tottenham at home - or Brighton at home, Inter Milan away, and Manchester United away.\nAssuming City qualify for the last-16, the first leg could take place on one of two midweeks in February. Either it could be played in between Premier League home fixtures against Everton and Chelsea, or it could be played between the Chelsea game and a trip to Bournemouth.\nThe second leg will be played in the middle of a difficult March fixture list, either between United at home and Liverpool away, or between Liverpool away and Brighton away.\nShould City progress to the quarter-finals, the first leg will come after the trip to Crystal Palace and before the visit of Luton. The second leg, a week later, will be played before the ever-difficult trip to Tottenham. However, should City or Spurs reach the FA Cup semi-finals, that would likely cause the Premier League game to be rearranged.\nOn to the potential semi-finals, and City face Nottingham Forest away before the first legs on April 30 or May 1. Then Wolves visit City at the weekend, before the second leg on May 7 or 8, and then a tricky trip to Fulham.\nALSO READ:\nFive key Man City dates as 2023/24 Premier League fixtures released","id_":"fa028008-3c7f-475b-8521-2ebf258e7c73"},"c70953e4-b065-48d6-99a6-b72a58baa5ef":{"label":"text_chunk","embedding":null,"properties":{"_node_content":"{\"id_\": \"c70953e4-b065-48d6-99a6-b72a58baa5ef\", \"embedding\": null, \"metadata\": {}, \"excluded_embed_metadata_keys\": [], \"excluded_llm_metadata_keys\": [], \"relationships\": {\"1\": {\"node_id\": \"0eb6360e-06c1-48af-bd5b-52f91d0432ef\", \"node_type\": \"4\", \"metadata\": {}, \"hash\": \"54dadfe194ed2a2da94c4c4e0b4d074903eb9a645ada5bd07ddc77562e2fd0a6\", \"class_name\": \"RelatedNodeInfo\"}}, \"metadata_template\": \"{key}: {value}\", \"metadata_separator\": \"\\n\", \"text\": \"\", \"mimetype\": \"text/plain\", \"start_char_idx\": 0, \"end_char_idx\": 1212, \"text_template\": \"{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}\", \"class_name\": \"TextNode\"}","_node_type":"TextNode","document_id":"0eb6360e-06c1-48af-bd5b-52f91d0432ef","doc_id":"0eb6360e-06c1-48af-bd5b-52f91d0432ef","ref_doc_id":"0eb6360e-06c1-48af-bd5b-52f91d0432ef"},"text":"Uber to shut food delivery business in Italy, exit Israel: Uber said on Thursday it will shut its food delivery business in Italy and exit Israel, where it has not built sufficient market share.\nThe moves were \"in line with our efforts to focus on markets where we have opportunities for sustainable growth\", a company spokesperson said.\nCEO Dara Khosrowshahi has said Uber will invest only in markets where it can be the largest or second largest player.\nUber trails Just Eat and Glovo in Italian food delivery, and Gett Taxi and Yango in the Israeli taxi and private hire market.\nThe company, which relies on self-employed contractors for its delivery service, said around 50 Uber employees and thousands of non-employee couriers and restaurants would be affected in Italy.\nAlso read | Uber accused of charging customers more when their phone battery is low: Report\nIt said it will continue to expand its mobility service there, where it works with dispatcher IT taxi.\nThe company's biggest markets in Europe are Britain, France, Spain and Germany.\nUber says it is seeing strong adoption by taxi drivers in Europe, who use the Uber app to supplement their curb-side ride hailing business.\nWATCH WION LIVE HERE:","id_":"c70953e4-b065-48d6-99a6-b72a58baa5ef"},"Chevron":{"label":"entity","embedding":null,"properties":{"relationship_description":"Chevron is a company that operates within the oil and gas (O&G) industry sector.","triplet_source_id":"58897347-bc34-4697-abb2-f65d1e4dc272"},"name":"Chevron"},"O&G Sector":{"label":"entity","embedding":null,"properties":{"triplet_source_id":"58897347-bc34-4697-abb2-f65d1e4dc272"},"name":"O&G Sector"},"NYSE":{"label":"entity","embedding":null,"properties":{"relationship_description":"Chevron is a company that operates within the oil and gas (O&G) industry sector.","triplet_source_id":"58897347-bc34-4697-abb2-f65d1e4dc272"},"name":"NYSE"},"European Commission":{"label":"entity","embedding":null,"properties":{"relationship_description":"The European Commission is planning to ban equipment from Huawei Technologies Co. from its internal telecommunications networks due to security concerns.","triplet_source_id":"98e70060-4de5-4c66-b926-2b40cd52c2d2"},"name":"European Commission"},"Huawei Technologies Co.":{"label":"entity","embedding":null,"properties":{"triplet_source_id":"98e70060-4de5-4c66-b926-2b40cd52c2d2"},"name":"Huawei Technologies Co."},"ZTE Corp.":{"label":"entity","embedding":null,"properties":{"relationship_description":"The European Commission is planning to ban equipment from Huawei Technologies Co. from its internal telecommunications networks due to security concerns.","triplet_source_id":"98e70060-4de5-4c66-b926-2b40cd52c2d2"},"name":"ZTE Corp."},"European Union":{"label":"Supranational Organization","embedding":null,"properties":{"entity_description":"The European Union is a political and economic union of 27 European countries.
